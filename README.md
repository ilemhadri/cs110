Hey there, Ismael,

I just created all of your course repos for the class.  I would rely on the following URL to reach the Autumn Quarter website going forward:

     https://web.stanford.edu/class/archive/cs/cs110/cs110.1212/

The current vanity URL of https://cs110.stanford.edu will soon be redirected to a separate directory set up for winter quarter, but the longer URL above is permanent.

Similarly, I would clone your git repos this way:
```
    git clone /usr/class/archive/cs/cs110/cs110.1212/repos/assign1/$USER assign1
    git clone /usr/class/archive/cs/cs110/cs110.1212/repos/assign2/$USER assign2
```
and so forth.  That way you'll be interacting with your official repos through the permanent paths.

Thanks, and let me know if you have any questions.
Jerry
