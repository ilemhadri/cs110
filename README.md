Hey there, Ismael,

I just created all of your course repos for the class.  I would rely on the following URL to reach the Autumn Quarter website going forward:

     https://web.stanford.edu/class/archive/cs/cs110/cs110.1212/

The current vanity URL of https://cs110.stanford.edu will soon be redirected to a separate directory set up for winter quarter, but the longer URL above is permanent.

Thanks, and let me know if you have any questions.
Jerry
